# ICA vs flashier

We want to compare fastICA's rank-1 update with that of flashier. Matthew previously examined an (example)[<https://stephens999.github.io/misc/fastica_02.html>] where rank-1 fastICA almost perfectly picks up one column of the true mixing matrix, but flashier does not. Our conjecture is that flashier's failure arises from an overemphasis on the *fit* term. We plan to investigate this further and potentially improve flashier's rank-1 update. More concretely, we posit this following model for an observed data matrix $\boldsymbol{Y}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{Y} &= \boldsymbol{M}+ \boldsymbol{\ell f}^\top + \boldsymbol{E} \\
\ell_{i}&\stackrel{iid}{\sim} g_\ell \\
f_{j}&\stackrel{iid}{\sim} g_f \\
E_{ij}&\stackrel{iid}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2),
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{M}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$. We hope that $\boldsymbol{M}$ can act as a 'stand-in' matrix—if one chooses to fit a rank-1 model even if the true signals are of rank\>1, $\boldsymbol{M}$ will capture any remaining true signals without leaking any to the error term.

## Objectives

1.  Find a small example in which fastICA works but PCA does not.

2.  In real data, does initializing flashier from fastICA produce better ELBO? Try it on some single cell data set. We should process the dataset in a way (e.g., log+1 transform) such that we can apply fastICA (which doesn't handle non-negative constraints)

3.  We conjecture that another possible reason why rank-1 flashier fails is the EB component. Try fixing the prior to the true data generating distribution.

4.  Try the following update:

    -   Update $\boldsymbol{\ell}$ and $\boldsymbol{f}$ by running flashier back fit on $\boldsymbol{Y}-\boldsymbol{M}$.

    -   Update $\boldsymbol{M}$ by truncated SVD on $\boldsymbol{Y} - \boldsymbol{\ell f}^\top$.

## Analyses

    -   exploration of 1, 3 and 4.
